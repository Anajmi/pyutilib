Overview
--------

The PyUtilib project supports a collection of Python utilities,
including a well-developed component architecture and extensions
to the PyUnit testing framework. PyUtilib has been developed to
support several Python-centric projects, especially
[Pyomo](http://pyomo.org).

PyUtilib is available under the BSD License.

Developer discussions are hosted by [google groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyutilib-developers).

PyUtilib development moved to this repository in October, 2015 from
Sandia National Laboratories.
